# MinecraftResourcesExtractor

This application can help you access Minecraft resources **faster**.

## Operation and Function

This application currently only has one function - **to copy Minecraft's resource files to the folder you specified**.

### Note

1. This application is only applicable to Windows.
2. When entering the game path and target path, please do not add path separators at the end.
3. Please strictly follow the prompts and commands. Please do not enter illegal characters.

## Finally

However, this is only the console version. In the near future, I will write a **desktop application** about this. Stay tuned!
